Visualizations include:
Confusion matrix heatmaps
Actual vs predicted plots
Accuracy comparison bar chart

Best Model Selection
The model with the highest accuracy on the test dataset is automatically selected and used for prediction on new patient data.

Sample Prediction
The trained model predicts whether a patient is likely to have Coronary Artery Disease based on given medical parameters.

Technologies Used:
Python
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-learn

Conclusion:
This project demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to medical data for disease prediction by comparing multiple models and selecting the best-performing one.
